# Hi, I am Dennis 👋👨‍💻
I studied "Electrical and Information Technologies" and focused on Control Engineering in the Master of my study. Afterwards I started as a software engineer. I love to work on algorithms, do data science or just developing a useful script. I have several years of work experiences especially in Python, but also in Java and some other programming languages.

## Hobbys ❤️
I love it to do photos, go hiking 🥾🥾 and skiing ⛷ or just enjoy my time with a nice ride on my e-bike 🚴‍♂️.
